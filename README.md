# Topaz
Seamlessly integrate your work and life with one powerful platform.

## Overview
**Topaz** is a open-source dashboard that prioritizes customization and productivity. 
If all goes well, **Topaz** will be a complete desktop app for all the major operating systems with the following features:
- Customizable Themes
- Customizable Widgets
- Customizable Status Bar
- Keyboard Shortcuts

## Development Progress
Topaz is currently in development. I just restarted, so there isn't much that's done so far.
Feel free to contribute!

### Using Topaz
You can download the latest development build on the [releases](https://github.com/jewels86/Topaz/releases) page. From there, you can unzip the app into the folder of your choice and run the app!

Please note that Topaz needs internet connection to create new workspaces or profiles, so you'll need to be connected on first startup.
